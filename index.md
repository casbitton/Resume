Hello, my name is **Cas**!

I’m an experienced IT Manager, Technical Leader, and Architect with a love for BBQ, coffee, Agile ways of working, and DevOps. Driven by a deep commitment to technology, I bring a hands-on, results-focused approach to help organisations streamline operations and achieve their goals.

With 20 years of hands-on IT experience, I’ve developed expertise in automation, infrastructure management, and DevOps, particularly within defence, government, finance, and critical infrastructure sectors. I specialise in designing resilient, high-performance systems that are secure, scalable, and efficient.

A practical innovator and mentor, I focus on optimising workflows, automating processes, and enhancing operational resilience. By blending Agile methodologies with a strategic, results-driven mindset, I consistently deliver client-centric solutions that drive long-term value.
