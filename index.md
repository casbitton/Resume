Hello, my name is **Cas**!

I'm a strategic technology leader and architect with two decades of hands-on experience building resilient, high-performance systems in defence, government, finance, and critical infrastructure. I lead with a people-first philosophy—empowering teams, anticipating risk, and translating complex technology strategy into sustainable business outcomes. Away from the office, you'll find me smoking low and slow BBQ or enjoying a great coffee - both fuel my passion for taking time to do things *right*.

My approach is fundamentally practical: a practical innovator and mentor who bridges the gap between ambitious vision and execution. I design secure and scalable IT environments that enable organisations to move faster, innovate confidently, and stay ahead of threat. I blend Agile methodologies with strategic thinking to drive lasting transformation, thriving in ambiguous, high-stakes environments where technical depth and clear communication deliver measurable outcomes.
